### What I learned
With this challenge i learned how to visually hide code but keep it available for screen reading devices, which make my code friendly for visually imparied folks. The code that i used was

.visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0); 
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap; 
  width: 1px;
}

also learned how to add media queries for images for mobile devices.

### Continued development

Still a bit confused about flexbox but i think with this challenge i got to master column grids and in-line flex-box.
I will continue practicing CSS variables. They made my workflow way easier and helps keeping me organized.
